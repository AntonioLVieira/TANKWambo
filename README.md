This is a series of premade scripts intended for kit bashing of quick game development experiments for the  [Licenciatura em Videojogos][lv] da [Universidade Lus√≥fona de Humanidades e Tecnologias][ULHT] in Lisbon.

It's currently still under development, and eventually will be commented properly, and have a manual.

It currently has two sample games (under the Samples directory), simple Pong and Breakout clones.
