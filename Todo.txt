- Add tooltips to everything with explanations
- Replace ranges used for random number generation with a "ValueSelector", which allows a literal, a range and a ValueHandler/Variable. The range can also use ValueHandler/Variable for the limits.
- Change numbers in most definitions (conditions, for example) by something that can be either a ValueHandler, a Variable, a literal, or a function, with a property drawer, etc
- Unify ValueHandler/Value with single selector that can take any of them
- Add HueShift/Outline effect for sprites
- Add LookAt action
- Add a tree view to explore objects in the games
- Warning/Error system
  - Error: Set scene object to prefab
  - Warning: No actions
  - Warning: No probabilities set for ActionRandom
  - Warning: No tags set for OnCollision
- Remove TriggerRandom
- Icons on Okapi scripts
- Replace code icons with actual icons (polutes images, but it's faster and less error prone)
- Comment Code
- Documentation

Usability:
----------
- Enable drag/drop of action into actions (ActionRandom, Triggers)
- Highlight action by clicking/scroll there (not sure if possible)
- How to make simple actions more accessible? (see Simple Usage)

Simple usage:
-------------
- Maybe create a wizard?
- Set object visible/invisible
- Set object velocity

Bugs:
-----
- Collision detection fails because of using RigidBody2D.MovePosition() instead of actual physics
- Set defaults for ActionRandom to 1 instead of 0 (change text)
- Some text gets wrapped instead of clipped on titles of text boxes
- Be consistent in use of Self/This
- Preserve velocity with Movement

Games:
------
- Add sounds to most games
- Add animations to Commando game
- Create FlagCatcher game
- Create UI game (strategy, need to think about this a lot)
- Create Platformer (movement system, IsGrounded test)
- Create SpyGame (add AI system - StateMachine)
- Create Driving (add AI system - Markov chains)
- Create Commando 2 game (add AI system - 2d path finding)
- Create Visual Novel game
